Hey there! I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience, currently based in Ankara, Turkey. But I'm one of those people who can't sit still – you might find me working from Serbia, hiking in Germany, or exploring South Africa. It's a crazy life, but I love it!

Right now, I'm super passionate about my work for a company helping kids with autism and their families get the best support.

Outside of work, I'm all about travel, trying to keep up with my running goals, and adventures in the kitchen (my latest dishes are...let's call them "experimental"!). I'm also a total fitness nut – kettlebells and gym rings are my latest obsession! I figure, why not share some of my progress here? A little extra motivation never hurt anyone, right?

I recently spent a bunch of time learning Spanish for a trip to Chile...turns out Chilean Spanish is a whole different beast! Still trying to wrap my head around it, mostly just for the fun of it.

Please reach me out for anything you have in your mind, would be very happy to meet anyone with a common passion with me.

> Not gonna lie to you, I am getting a lot of help from AI to generate this stuff here. Cheers!
